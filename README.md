# dinero.go
This is a port of the [v2 dinero.js](https://github.com/dinerojs/dinero.js/) library written in Go.
A JavaScript Dinero Snapshot can be unmarshalled directly into a Go Dinero, making a dinero object interchangable across the a JS/Node frontend, a Go backend, and a NoSql storage layer.

The API is almost identical to it's JavaScript counterpart. Please refer to the JS documentation for more information.
